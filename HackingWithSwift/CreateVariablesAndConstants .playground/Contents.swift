var greeting = "Hello, playground"

// var = create a new variable
// name = our variables name -> name it anything but should be descriptive generally
// = = assign something
// "Ted" = the initial value
name = "Rebecca"

// creating a variable means the value can change over time
// if you dont ever want to change a value... you use a constant:
let character = "Daphne"
